# RandomlandWebScraper
This is the script I wrote to scrape stock status information from Justin Scarred's Randomland store. The purpose of this was because I  wanted to be able to run a script to know the status of all items at once without navigating to the website itself. I will schedule this script to run and let me know when certain items I want to purchase are in stock.

#ToDo
Maybe I will include more code using Twilio to send me a text message via Python.
